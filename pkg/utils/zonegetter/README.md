The `pkg/utils/zonegetter` package provides a `ZoneGetter` utility for determining the zones and subnets of Kubernetes nodes. It is designed to work in two distinct modes: GCP and NonGCP.

### GCP Mode

In its primary GCP mode, the `ZoneGetter` interacts with the Kubernetes API to retrieve node information. Its key functionalities include:

*   **Zone and Subnet Discovery:** It determines a node's zone by parsing the `providerID` field in the node's specification, which for GCP has the format `gce://<project-id>/<zone>/<instance-name>`. It can also identify the node's subnet.
*   **Node Filtering:** The `ZoneGetter` can list nodes based on different filtering criteria:
    *   `AllNodesFilter`: Returns all nodes.
    *   `CandidateNodesFilter`: Returns only nodes that are considered eligible for load balancing (i.e., are in a "Ready" state and do not have labels that exclude them from load balancers).
    *   `CandidateAndUnreadyNodesFilter`: A slightly more relaxed filter that includes unready nodes but excludes nodes that are in the process of being upgraded.
*   **Zone Listing:** It can provide a list of all unique zones that contain nodes, subject to the same filtering logic as node listing.
*   **Multi-Subnet Awareness:** The `ZoneGetter` includes logic to handle multi-subnet clusters, with the capability to filter nodes to include only those belonging to the cluster's default subnet.

### Legacy Network Mode

A special mode for handling GCE legacy networks where a subnetwork URL is not specified. When enabled, the `ZoneGetter` assumes all nodes belong to a single, default network. This prevents errors from attempting to parse an empty subnet URL and ensures that all nodes are correctly considered for load balancing. In this mode, subnet-related checks are short-circuited to reflect the simpler network topology.

### NonGCP Mode

For environments not running on GCP, the `ZoneGetter` can be configured in a simplified `NonGCP` mode. In this mode, it is initialized with a single, predetermined zone and will always return that zone when queried, without interacting with the Kubernetes API for node information.

In essence, the `zonegetter` is a crucial component for the ingress controller to make topology-aware decisions, such as configuring regional load balancer backends, by accurately identifying the location of nodes within the GCP environment.
