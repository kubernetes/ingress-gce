## How do I deploy an Ingress controller?

On GCP (either GCE or GKE), every Kubernetes cluster has an Ingress controller
running on the master, no deployment necessary. You can deploy a second,
different (i.e non-GCE) controller, like [this](README.md#how-do-i-deploy-an-ingress-controller).
If you wish to deploy a GCE controller as a pod in your cluster, make sure to
turn down the existing auto-deployed Ingress controller as shown in this
[example](/examples/deployment/gce/).

## I created an Ingress and nothing happens, now what?

Please check the following:

1. Output of `kubectl describe`, as shown [here](README.md#i-created-an-ingress-and-nothing-happens-what-now)
2. Do your Services all have a `NodePort`?
3. Do your Services either serve an HTTP status code 200 on `/`, or have a readiness probe
   as described in [this section](#can-i-configure-gce-health-checks-through-the-ingress)?
4. Do you have enough GCP quota?

## What are the cloud resources created for a single Ingress?

__Terminology:__

* [Global Forwarding Rule](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/http/global-forwarding-rules): Manages the Ingress VIP
* [TargetHttpProxy](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/http/target-proxies): Manages SSL certs and proxies between the VIP and backend
* [URL Map](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/http/url-map): Routing rules
* [Backend Service](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/http/backend-service): Bridges various Instance Groups on a given Service NodePort
* [Instance Group](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/): Collection of Kubernetes nodes

The pipeline is as follows:

```
Global Forwarding Rule -> TargetHTTPProxy
        |                                  \                               Instance Group (us-east1)
    Static IP                               URL Map - Backend Service(s) - Instance Group (us-central1)
        |                                  /                               ...
Global Forwarding Rule -> TargetHTTPSProxy
                            SSL cert
```

In addition to this pipeline:
* Each Backend Service requires a HTTP or HTTPS health check to the NodePort of the Service
* Each port on the Backend Service has a matching port on the Instance Group
* Each port on the Backend Service is exposed through a firewall-rule open
  to the GCE LB IP ranges (`130.211.0.0/22` and `35.191.0.0/16`)

## The Ingress controller events complain about quota, how do I increase it?

GLBC is not aware of your GCE quota. As of this writing users get 3
[GCE Backend Services](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/http/backend-service)
by default. If you plan on creating Ingresses for multiple Kubernetes Services,
remember that each one requires a backend service, and request quota. Should you
fail to do so the controller will poll periodically and grab the first free
backend service slot it finds. You can view your quota:

```console
$ gcloud compute project-info describe --project myproject
```
See [GCE documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/resource-quotas#checking_your_quota)
for how to request more.

## Why does the Ingress need a different instance group then the GKE cluster?

The controller adds/removes Kubernetes nodes that are `NotReady` from the lb
instance group. We cannot simply rely on health checks to achieve this for
a few reasons.

First, older Kubernetes versions (<=1.3) did not mark
endpoints on unreachable nodes as NotReady. Meaning if the Kubelet didn't
heart beat for 10s, the node was marked NotReady, but there was no other signal
at the Service level to stop routing requests to endpoints on that node. In
later Kubernetes version this is handled a little better, if the Kubelet
doesn't heart beat for 10s it's marked NotReady, if it stays in NotReady
for 40s all endpoints are marked NotReady. So it is still advantageous
to pull the node out of the GCE LB Instance Group in 10s, because we
save 30s of bad requests.

Second, continuing to send requests to NotReady nodes is not a great idea.
The NotReady condition is an aggregate of various factors. For example,
a NotReady node might still pass health checks but have the wrong
nodePort to endpoint mappings. The health check will pass as long as *something*
returns a HTTP 200.

## Why does the cloud console show 0/N healthy instances?

Some nodes are reporting negatively on the GCE HTTP health check.
Please check the following:
1. Try to access any node-ip:node-port/health-check-url
2. Try to access any pubic-ip:node-port/health-check-url
3. Make sure you have a firewall-rule allowing access to the GCE LB IP range
   (created by the Ingress controller on your behalf)
4. Make sure the right NodePort is opened in the Backend Service, and
   consequently, plugged into the lb instance group

## Can I configure GCE health checks through the Ingress?

Currently health checks are not exposed through the Ingress resource, they're
handled at the node level by Kubernetes daemons (kube-proxy and the kubelet).
However the GCE L7 lb still requires a HTTP(S) health check to measure node
health. By default, this health check points at `/` on the nodePort associated
with a given backend. Note that the purpose of this health check is NOT to
determine when endpoint pods are overloaded, but rather, to detect when a
given node is incapable of proxying requests for the Service:nodePort
altogether. Overloaded endpoints are removed from the working set of a
Service via readiness probes conducted by the kubelet.

If `/` doesn't work for your application, you can have the Ingress controller
program the GCE health check to point at a readiness probe as shows in [this](/examples/health-checks/)
example.

We plan to surface health checks through the API soon.

## Why does my Ingress have an ephemeral ip?

GCE has a concept of [ephemeral](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances-and-network#ephemeraladdress)
and [static](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances-and-network#reservedaddress) IPs. A production
website would always want a static IP, which ephemeral IPs are cheaper (both in terms of quota and cost), and
are therefore better suited for experimentation.
* Creating a HTTP Ingress (i.e an Ingress without a TLS section) allocates an ephemeral IP for 2 reasons:
   * we want to encourage secure defaults
   * static-ips have limited quota and pure HTTP ingress is often used for testing
* Creating an Ingress with a TLS section allocates a static IP
* Modifying an Ingress and adding a TLS section allocates a static IP, but the
  IP *will* change. This is a beta limitation.
* You can [promote](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances-and-network#promote_ephemeral_ip)
  an ephemeral to a static IP by hand, if required.

## Can I pre-allocate a static-ip?

Yes, please see [this](/examples/static-ip) example.

## Does updating a Kubernetes secret update the GCE TLS certs?

Yes, expect O(30s) delay.

The controller should create a second SSL certificate suffixed with `-1` and
atomically swap it with the SSL certificate in your target proxy, then delete
the obsolete SSL certificate.

## Can I tune the loadbalancing algorithm?

Right now, a kube-proxy NodePort service is a necessary condition for Ingress on GCP.
This is because the cloud LB doesn't understand how to route directly to your
pods. Incorporating kube-proxy and cloud lb algorithms so they cooperate
toward a common goal is still a work in progress. If you really want fine
grained control over the algorithm, you should deploy the [nginx controller](/examples/deployment/nginx).

## Is there a maximum number of Endpoints I can add to the Ingress?

This limit is directly related to the maximum number of endpoints allowed in a
Kubernetes cluster, not the the HTTP LB configuration, since the HTTP LB sends
packets to VMs. Ingress is not yet supported on single zone clusters of size >
1000 nodes ([issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/issues/1724)). If
you'd like to use Ingress on a large cluster, spread it across 2 or more zones
such that no single zone contains more than a 1000 nodes. This is because there
is a [limit](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/creating-groups-of-managed-instances)
to the number of instances one can add to a single GCE Instance Group. In a
multi-zone cluster, each zone gets its own instance group.

## How do I match GCE resources to Kubernetes Services?

The format followed for creating resources in the cloud is:
`k8s-<resource-name>-<nodeport>-<cluster-hash>`, where `nodeport` is the output of
```console
$ kubectl get svc <svcname> --template '{{range $i, $e := .spec.ports}}{{$e.nodePort}},{{end}}'
```

`cluster-hash` is the output of:
```console
$ kubectl get configmap -o yaml --namespace=kube-system | grep -i " data:" -A 1
  data:
    uid: cad4ee813812f808
```

and `resource-name` is a short prefix for one of the resources mentioned [here](#what-are-the-cloud-resources-created-for-a-single-ingress)
(eg: `be` for backends, `hc` for health checks). If a given resource is not tied
to a single `node-port`, its name will not include the same.

## Can I change the cluster UID?

The Ingress controller configures itself to add the UID it stores in a configmap in the `kube-system` namespace.

```console
$ kubectl --namespace=kube-system get configmaps
NAME          DATA      AGE
ingress-uid   1         12d

$ kubectl --namespace=kube-system get configmaps -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
items:
- apiVersion: v1
  data:
    uid: UID
  kind: ConfigMap
...
```

You can pick a different UID, but this requires you to:

1. Delete existing Ingresses
2. Edit the configmap using `kubectl edit`
3. Recreate the same Ingress

After step 3 the Ingress should come up using the new UID as the suffix of all cloud resources. You can't simply change the UID if you have existing Ingresses, because
renaming a cloud resource requires a delete/create cycle that the Ingress controller does not currently automate. Note that the UID in step 1 might be an empty string,
if you had a working Ingress before upgrading to Kubernetes 1.3.

__A note on setting the UID__: The Ingress controller uses the token `--` to split a machine generated prefix from the UID itself. If the user supplied UID is found to
contain `--` the controller will take the token after the last `--`, and use an empty string if it ends with `--`. For example, if you insert `foo--bar` as the UID,
the controller will assume `bar` is the UID. You can either edit the configmap and set the UID to `bar` to match the controller, or delete existing Ingresses as described
above, and reset it to a string bereft of `--`.

## Why do I need a default backend?

All GCE URL maps require at least one [default backend](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/http/url-map#url_map_simplest_case), which handles all
requests that don't match a host/path. In Ingress, the default backend is
optional, since the resource is cross-platform and not all platforms require
a default backend. If you don't specify one in your yaml, the GCE ingress
controller will inject the default-http-backend Service that runs in the
`kube-system` namespace as the default backend for the GCE HTTP lb allocated
for that Ingress resource.

Some caveats concerning the default backend:

* It is the only Backend Service that doesn't directly map to a user specified
NodePort Service
* It's created when the first Ingress is created, and deleted when the last
Ingress is deleted, since we don't want to waste quota if the user is not going
to need L7 loadbalancing through Ingress
* It has a HTTP health check pointing at `/healthz`, not the default `/`, because
`/` serves a 404 by design


## How does Ingress work across 2 GCE clusters?

See kubemci [documentation](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/k8s-multicluster-ingress).

## I shutdown a cluster without deleting all Ingresses, how do I manually cleanup?

If you kill a cluster without first deleting Ingresses, the resources will leak.
If you find yourself in such a situation, you can delete the resources by hand:

1. Navigate to the [cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and click on the "Networking" tab, then choose "LoadBalancing"
2. Find the loadbalancer you'd like to delete, it should have a name formatted as: `k8s-um-ns-name--UUID`
3. Delete it, check the boxes to also cascade the deletion down to associated resources (eg: backend-services)
4. Switch to the "Compute Engine" tab, then choose "Instance Groups"
5. Delete the Instance Group allocated for the leaked Ingress, it should have a name formatted as: `k8s-ig-UUID`

We plan to fix this [soon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/16337).

## How do I disable the GCE Ingress controller?

As of Kubernetes 1.3, GLBC runs as a static pod on the master.
If you want to disable it, you have 3 options:

### Soft disable

Option 1. Have it no-op for an Ingress resource based on the `ingress.class` annotation as shown [here](README.md#how-do-i-disable-an-ingress-controller).
This can also be used to use one of the other Ingress controllers at the same time as the GCE controller.

### Hard disable

Option 2. SSH into the GCE master node and delete the GLBC manifest file found at `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/glbc.manifest`.

Option 3. Disable the addon in GKE via `gcloud`:

#### Disabling GCE ingress on cluster creation

Disable the addon in GKE at cluster bring-up time through the `disable-addons` flag:

```console
gcloud container clusters create mycluster --network "default" --num-nodes 1 \
--machine-type n1-standard-2 \
--zone $ZONE \
--disk-size 50 \
--scopes storage-full \
--disable-addons HttpLoadBalancing
```

#### Disabling GCE ingress in an existing cluster

Disable the addon in GKE for an existing cluster through the `update-addons` flag:

```console
gcloud container clusters update mycluster --update-addons HttpLoadBalancing=DISABLED
```

## What GCE resources are shared between Ingresses?

Every Ingress creates a pipeline of GCE cloud resources behind an IP. Some of
these are shared between Ingresses out of necessity, while some are shared
because there was no perceived need for duplication (all resources consume
quota and usually cost money).

Shared:

* Backend Services: because of low quota and high reuse. A single Service in a
Kubernetes cluster has one NodePort, common throughout the cluster. GCE has
a hard limit of the number of allowed Backend Services, so if multiple Ingresses
all point to a single Service, that creates a single Backend Service in GCE
pointing to that Service's NodePort.

* Instance Group: since an instance can only be part of a single loadbalanced
Instance Group, these must be shared. There is 1 Ingress Instance Group per
zone containing Kubernetes nodes.

* Health Checks: currently the health checks point at the NodePort
of a Backend Service. They don't *need* to be shared, but they are since
Backend Services are shared.

* Firewall rule: There is a single firewall rule
that covers health check traffic from the range of [GCE loadbalancer IPs](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/http/#troubleshooting)
to entire NodePort range.

Unique:

Currently, a single Ingress on GCE creates a unique IP and URL Map. In this
model the following resources cannot be shared:
* URL Map
* Target HTTP(S) Proxies
* SSL Certificates
* Static-ip
* Forwarding rules


## How do I debug a controller spinloop?

The most likely cause of a controller spin loop is some form of GCE validation
failure, eg:
* It's trying to delete a Backend Service already in use, say in a URL Map
* It's trying to add an Instance to more than 1 loadbalanced Instance Groups
* It's trying to flip the loadbalancing algorithm on a Backend Service to RATE,
when some other Backend Service is pointing at the same Instance Group and asking
for UTILIZATION

In all such cases, the work queue will put a single key (ingress namespace/name)
that's getting continuously re-queued into exponential backoff. However, currently
the Informers that watch the Kubernetes API are setup to periodically resync,
so even though a particular key is in backoff, we might end up syncing all other
keys every, say, 10m, which might trigger the same validation-error-condition
when syncing a shared resource.

## Creating an Internal Load Balancer without existing ingress
**How the GCE ingress controller Works**  
To assemble an L7 Load Balancer, the ingress controller creates an [unmanaged instance-group](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/creating-groups-of-unmanaged-instances) named `k8s-ig--{UID}` and adds every known minion node to the group. For every service specified in all ingresses, a Backend Service is created to point to that instance group.

**How the Internal Load Balancer Works**  
K8s does not yet assemble ILB's for you, but you can manually create one via the GCP Console. The ILB is composed of a regional forwarding rule and a regional Backend Service. Similar to the L7 LB, the Backend Service points to an unmanaged instance-group containing your K8s nodes.

**The Complication**  
GCP will only allow one load balanced unmanaged instance-group for a given instance.
If you manually created an instance group named something like `my-kubernetes-group` containing all your nodes and put an ILB in front of it, then you will probably encounter a GCP error when setting up an ingress resource. The controller doesn't know to use your `my-kubernetes-group` group and will create it's own. Unfortunately, it won't be able to add any nodes to that group because they already belong to the ILB group.

As mentioned before, the instance group name is composed of a hard-coded prefix `k8s-ig--` and a cluster-specific UID. The ingress controller will check the K8s configmap for an existing UID value at process start. If it doesn't exist, the controller will create one randomly and update the configmap.

#### Solutions  
**Want an ILB and Ingress?**  
If you plan on creating both ingresses and internal load balancers, simply create the ingress resource first then use the GCP Console to create an ILB pointing to the existing instance group.

**Want just an ILB for now, ingress maybe later?**  
Retrieve the UID via configmap, create an instance-group per used zone, then add all respective nodes to the group.
```shell
# Fetch instance group name from config map
GROUPNAME=`kubectl get configmaps ingress-uid -o jsonpath='k8s-ig--{.data.uid}' --namespace=kube-system`

# Create an instance group for every zone you have nodes. If you use GKE, this is probably a single zone.
gcloud compute instance-groups unmanaged create $GROUPNAME --zone {ZONE}

# Look at your list of your nodes
kubectl get nodes

# Add minion nodes that exist in zone X to the instance group in zone X. (Do not add the master!)
gcloud compute instance-groups unmanaged add-instances $GROUPNAME --zone {ZONE} --instances=A,B,C...
```
You can now follow the GCP Console wizard for creating an internal load balancer and point to the `k8s-ig--{UID}` instance group.

## Can I use websockets?
Yes!  
The GCP HTTP(S) Load Balancer supports websockets. You do not need to change your HTTP server or Kubernetes deployment. You will need to manually configure the created Backend Service's `timeout` setting. This value is the interpreted as the max connection duration. The default value of 30 seconds is probably too small for your needs. You can increase it to the supported maximum: 86400 (a day) through the GCP Console or the gcloud CLI.

View the [example](/controllers/gce/examples/websocket/).
