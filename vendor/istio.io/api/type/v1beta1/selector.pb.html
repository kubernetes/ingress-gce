<section>
<p>WorkloadSelector specifies the criteria used to determine if a policy can be applied
to a proxy. The matching criteria includes the metadata associated with a proxy,
workload instance info such as labels attached to the pod/VM, or any other info
that the proxy provides to Istio during the initial handshake. If multiple conditions are
specified, all conditions need to match in order for the workload instance to be
selected. Currently, only label based selection mechanism is supported.</p>

<p>WorkloadMode allows selection of the role of the underlying workload in
network traffic. A workload is considered as acting as a SERVER if it is
the destination of the traffic (that is, traffic direction, from the
perspective of the workload is <em>inbound</em>). If the workload is the source of
the network traffic, it is considered to be in CLIENT mode (traffic is
<em>outbound</em> from the workload).</p>

<p>Selects for scenarios when the workload is the
source of the network traffic. In addition,
if the workload is a gateway, selects this.</p>
