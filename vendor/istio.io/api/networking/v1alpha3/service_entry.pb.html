<p><code>ServiceEntry</code> enables adding additional entries into Istio&rsquo;s
internal service registry, so that auto-discovered services in the
mesh can access/route to these manually specified services. A
service entry describes the properties of a service (DNS name,
VIPs, ports, protocols, endpoints). These services could be
external to the mesh (e.g., web APIs) or mesh-internal services
that are not part of the platform&rsquo;s service registry (e.g., a set
of VMs talking to services in Kubernetes). In addition, the
endpoints of a service entry can also be dynamically selected by
using the <code>workloadSelector</code> field. These endpoints can be VM
workloads declared using the <code>WorkloadEntry</code> object or Kubernetes
pods. The ability to select both pods and VMs under a single
service allows for migration of services from VMs to Kubernetes
without having to change the existing DNS names associated with the
services.</p>
<p>The following example declares a few external APIs accessed by internal
applications over HTTPS. The sidecar inspects the SNI value in the
ClientHello message to route to the appropriate external service.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: ServiceEntry
metadata:
  name: external-svc-https
spec:
  hosts:

  - api.facebook.com
  location: MESH_EXTERNAL
  ports:
  - number: 443
    name: https
    protocol: TLS
  resolution: DNS
</code></pre>
<p>The following configuration adds a set of MongoDB instances running on
unmanaged VMs to Istio&rsquo;s registry, so that these services can be treated
as any other service in the mesh. The associated DestinationRule is used
to initiate mTLS connections to the database instances.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1

    name: mongodb
    protocol: MONGO
  location: MESH_INTERNAL
  resolution: STATIC
  endpoints:
  - address: 2.2.2.2
  - address: 3.3.3.3
</code></pre>
<p>and the associated DestinationRule</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: mtls-mongocluster
spec:
  host: mymongodb.somedomain
  trafficPolicy:
    tls:
      mode: MUTUAL
      clientCertificate: /etc/certs/myclientcert.pem
      privateKey: /etc/certs/client_private_key.pem
      caCertificates: /etc/certs/rootcacerts.pem
</code></pre>
<p>The following example uses a combination of service entry and TLS
routing in a virtual service to steer traffic based on the SNI value to
an internal egress firewall.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: ServiceEntry
metadata:
  name: external-svc-redirect
spec:
  hosts:
  - wikipedia.org
  - &quot;*.wikipedia.org&quot;
  location: MESH_EXTERNAL
  ports:
  - number: 443
    name: https
    protocol: TLS
  resolution: NONE
</code></pre>
<p>And the associated VirtualService to route based on the SNI value.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: tls-routing
spec:
  hosts:
  - wikipedia.org
  - &quot;*.wikipedia.org&quot;
  tls:
  - match:
    - sniHosts:
      - wikipedia.org
      - &quot;*.wikipedia.org&quot;
    route:
    - destination:
        host: internal-egress-firewall.ns1.svc.cluster.local
</code></pre>
<p>The virtual service with TLS match serves to override the default SNI
match. In the absence of a virtual service, traffic will be forwarded to
the wikipedia domains.</p>
<p>The following example demonstrates the use of a dedicated egress gateway
through which all external service traffic is forwarded.
The &rsquo;exportTo&rsquo; field allows for control over the visibility of a service
declaration to other namespaces in the mesh. By default, a service is exported
to all namespaces. The following example restricts the visibility to the
current namespace, represented by &ldquo;.&rdquo;, so that it cannot be used by other
namespaces.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: ServiceEntry
metadata:
  name: external-svc-httpbin
  namespace: egress
spec:
  hosts:
  - example.com
  exportTo:
  - &quot;.&quot;
  location: MESH_EXTERNAL
  ports:
  - number: 80
    name: http
    protocol: HTTP
  resolution: DNS
</code></pre>
<p>Define a gateway to handle all egress traffic.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
 name: istio-egressgateway
 namespace: istio-system
spec:
 selector:
   istio: egressgateway
 servers:
 - port:
     number: 80
     name: http
     protocol: HTTP
   hosts:
   - &quot;*&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>And the associated <code>VirtualService</code> to route from the sidecar to the
gateway service (<code>istio-egressgateway.istio-system.svc.cluster.local</code>), as
well as route from the gateway to the external service. Note that the
virtual service is exported to all namespaces enabling them to route traffic
through the gateway to the external service. Forcing traffic to go through
a managed middle proxy like this is a common practice.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: gateway-routing
  namespace: egress
spec:
  hosts:
  - example.com
  exportTo:
  - &quot;*&quot;
  gateways:
  - mesh
  - istio-egressgateway
  http:
  - match:
    - port: 80
      gateways:
      - mesh
    route:
    - destination:
        host: istio-egressgateway.istio-system.svc.cluster.local

    - port: 80
      gateways:
      - istio-egressgateway
    route:
    - destination:
        host: example.com
</code></pre>
<p>The following example demonstrates the use of wildcards in the hosts for
external services. If the connection has to be routed to the IP address
requested by the application (i.e. application resolves DNS and attempts
to connect to a specific IP), the resolution mode must be set to <code>NONE</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: ServiceEntry
metadata:
  name: external-svc-wildcard-example
spec:
  hosts:
  - &quot;*.bar.com&quot;
  location: MESH_EXTERNAL
  ports:
  - number: 80
    name: http
    protocol: HTTP
  resolution: NONE
</code></pre>
<p>The following example demonstrates a service that is available via a
Unix Domain Socket on the host of the client. The resolution must be
set to STATIC to use Unix address endpoints.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: ServiceEntry
metadata:
  name: unix-domain-socket-example
spec:
  hosts:
  - &quot;example.unix.local&quot;
  location: MESH_EXTERNAL
  ports:
  - number: 80
    name: http
    protocol: HTTP
  resolution: STATIC
  endpoints:
  - address: unix:///var/run/example/socket
</code></pre>
<p>For HTTP-based services, it is possible to create a <code>VirtualService</code>
backed by multiple DNS addressable endpoints. In such a scenario, the
application can use the <code>HTTP_PROXY</code> environment variable to transparently
reroute API calls for the <code>VirtualService</code> to a chosen backend. For
example, the following configuration creates a non-existent external
service called foo.bar.com backed by three domains: us.foo.bar.com:8080,
uk.foo.bar.com:9080, and in.foo.bar.com:7080</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: ServiceEntry
metadata:
  name: external-svc-dns
spec:
  hosts:
  - foo.bar.com
  location: MESH_EXTERNAL
  ports:
  - number: 80
    name: http
    protocol: HTTP
  resolution: DNS
  endpoints:
  - address: us.foo.bar.com
    ports:
      http: 8080
  - address: uk.foo.bar.com
    ports:
      http: 9080
  - address: in.foo.bar.com
    ports:
      http: 7080
</code></pre>
<p>With <code>HTTP_PROXY=http://localhost/</code>, calls from the application to
<code>http://foo.bar.com</code> will be load balanced across the three domains
specified above. In other words, a call to <code>http://foo.bar.com/baz</code> would
be translated to <code>http://uk.foo.bar.com/baz</code>.</p>
<p>The following example illustrates the usage of a <code>ServiceEntry</code>
containing a subject alternate name
whose format conforms to the <a href="https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe/blob/master/standards/SPIFFE-ID.md">SPIFFE standard</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: ServiceEntry
metadata:
  name: httpbin
  namespace: httpbin-ns
spec:
  hosts:
  - example.com
  location: MESH_INTERNAL
  ports:
  - number: 80
    name: http
    protocol: HTTP
  resolution: STATIC
  endpoints:
  - address: 2.2.2.2
  - address: 3.3.3.3
  subjectAltNames:
  - &quot;spiffe://cluster.local/ns/httpbin-ns/sa/httpbin-service-account&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The following example demonstrates the use of <code>ServiceEntry</code> with a
<code>workloadSelector</code> to handle the migration of a service
<code>details.bookinfo.com</code> from VMs to Kubernetes. The service has two
VM-based instances with sidecars as well as a set of Kubernetes
pods managed by a standard deployment object. Consumers of this
service in the mesh will be automatically load balanced across the
VMs and Kubernetes.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: WorkloadEntry
metadata:
  name: details-vm-1
spec:
  serviceAccount: details
  address: 2.2.2.2
  labels:
    app: details
    instance-id: vm1
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: WorkloadEntry
metadata:
  name: details-vm-2
spec:
  serviceAccount: details
  address: 3.3.3.3
  labels:
    app: details
    instance-id: vm2
</code></pre>
<p>Assuming there is also a Kubernetes deployment with pod labels
<code>app: details</code> using the same service account <code>details</code>, the
following service entry declares a service spanning both VMs and
Kubernetes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: ServiceEntry
metadata:
  name: details-svc
spec:
  hosts:
  - details.bookinfo.com

    name: http
    protocol: HTTP
  resolution: STATIC

the incoming traffic will be identified as belonging to this service
if the destination IP matches the IP/CIDRs specified in the addresses

service in the mesh. In other words, the sidecar will behave as a
simple TCP proxy, forwarding incoming traffic on a specified port to
the specified destination endpoint IP/host. Unix domain socket
addresses are not supported in this field. Although the API allows
specifying addresses in a list, multiple addresses will not be used by a single host.

compatible with raw TCP traffic where the original host cannot
