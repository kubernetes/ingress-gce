<p>Configuration affecting traffic routing. Here are a few terms useful to define
in the context of traffic routing.</p>
<p><code>Service</code> a unit of application behavior bound to a unique name in a
service registry. Services consist of multiple network <em>endpoints</em>
implemented by workload instances running on pods, containers, VMs etc.</p>
<p><code>Service versions (a.k.a. subsets)</code> - In a continuous deployment
scenario, for a given service, there can be distinct subsets of
instances running different variants of the application binary. These
variants are not necessarily different API versions. They could be
iterative changes to the same service, deployed in different
environments (prod, staging, dev, etc.). Common scenarios where this
occurs include A/B testing, canary rollouts, etc. The choice of a
particular version can be decided based on various criterion (headers,
url, etc.) and/or by weights assigned to each version. Each service has
a default version consisting of all its instances.</p>
<p><code>Source</code> - A downstream client calling a service.</p>
<p><code>Host</code> - The address used by a client when attempting to connect to a
service.</p>
<p><code>Access model</code> - Applications address only the destination service
(Host) without knowledge of individual service versions (subsets). The
actual choice of the version is determined by the proxy/sidecar, enabling the
application code to decouple itself from the evolution of dependent
services.</p>
<p>A <code>VirtualService</code> defines a set of traffic routing rules to apply when a host is
addressed. Each routing rule defines matching criteria for traffic of a specific
protocol. If the traffic is matched, then it is sent to a named destination service
(or subset/version of it) defined in the registry.</p>
<p>The source of traffic can also be matched in a routing rule. This allows routing
to be customized for specific client contexts.</p>
<p>The following example on Kubernetes, routes all HTTP traffic by default to
pods of the reviews service with label &ldquo;version: v1&rdquo;. In addition,
HTTP requests with path starting with /wpcatalog/ or /consumercatalog/ will
be rewritten to /newcatalog and sent to pods with label &ldquo;version: v2&rdquo;.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews-route
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews.prod.svc.cluster.local
  http:
  - name: &quot;reviews-v2-routes&quot;
    match:
    - uri:
        prefix: &quot;/wpcatalog&quot;
    - uri:
        prefix: &quot;/consumercatalog&quot;
    rewrite:
      uri: &quot;/newcatalog&quot;

    route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews.prod.svc.cluster.local
        subset: v1
</code></pre>
<p>A subset/version of a route destination is identified with a reference
to a named service subset which must be declared in a corresponding
<code>DestinationRule</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1

<p>The destination hosts to which traffic is being sent. Could
be a DNS name with wildcard prefix or an IP address.  Depending on the
platform, short-names can also be used instead of a FQDN (i.e. has no
dots in the name). In such a scenario, the FQDN of the host would be
derived based on the underlying platform.</p>
<p>A single VirtualService can be used to describe all the traffic
properties of the corresponding hosts, including those for multiple
HTTP and TCP ports. Alternatively, the traffic properties of a host
can be defined using more than one VirtualService, with certain
caveats. Refer to the
<a href="https://istio.io/docs/ops/best-practices/traffic-management/#split-virtual-services">Operations Guide</a>
for details.</p>
<p><em>Note for Kubernetes users</em>: When short names are used (e.g. &ldquo;reviews&rdquo;
instead of &ldquo;reviews.default.svc.cluster.local&rdquo;), Istio will interpret
the short name based on the namespace of the rule, not the service. A
rule in the &ldquo;default&rdquo; namespace containing a host &ldquo;reviews&rdquo; will be
interpreted as &ldquo;reviews.default.svc.cluster.local&rdquo;, irrespective of
the actual namespace associated with the reviews service. <em>To avoid
potential misconfigurations, it is recommended to always use fully
qualified domain names over short names.</em></p>
<p>The hosts field applies to both HTTP and TCP services. Service inside
the mesh, i.e., those found in the service registry, must always be
referred to using their alphanumeric names. IP addresses are allowed
only for services defined via the Gateway.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: It must be empty for a delegate VirtualService.</p>

Gateways in other namespaces may be referred to by

namespace. A single VirtualService is used for sidecars inside the mesh as
well as for one or more gateways. The selection condition imposed by this
field can be overridden using the source field in the match conditions
of protocol-specific routes. The reserved word <code>mesh</code> is used to imply
all the sidecars in the mesh. When this field is omitted, the default
gateway (<code>mesh</code>) will be used, which would apply the rule to all
sidecars in the mesh. If a list of gateway names is provided, the

<h2 id="Destination">Destination</h2>
<section>
<p>Destination indicates the network addressable service to which the
request/connection will be sent after processing a routing rule. The
destination.host should unambiguously refer to a service in the service
registry. Istio&rsquo;s service registry is composed of all the services found
in the platform&rsquo;s service registry (e.g., Kubernetes services, Consul
services), as well as services declared through the
<a href="https://istio.io/docs/reference/config/networking/service-entry/#ServiceEntry">ServiceEntry</a> resource.</p>
<p><em>Note for Kubernetes users</em>: When short names are used (e.g. &ldquo;reviews&rdquo;
instead of &ldquo;reviews.default.svc.cluster.local&rdquo;), Istio will interpret
the short name based on the namespace of the rule, not the service. A
rule in the &ldquo;default&rdquo; namespace containing a host &ldquo;reviews&rdquo; will be
interpreted as &ldquo;reviews.default.svc.cluster.local&rdquo;, irrespective of the
actual namespace associated with the reviews service. <em>To avoid potential
misconfigurations, it is recommended to always use fully qualified
domain names over short names.</em></p>
<p>The following Kubernetes example routes all traffic by default to pods
of the reviews service with label &ldquo;version: v1&rdquo; (i.e., subset v1), and
some to subset v2, in a Kubernetes environment.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews-route
  namespace: foo
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews # interpreted as reviews.foo.svc.cluster.local
  http:
  - match:
    - uri:
        prefix: &quot;/wpcatalog&quot;
    - uri:
        prefix: &quot;/consumercatalog&quot;
    rewrite:
      uri: &quot;/newcatalog&quot;
    route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews # interpreted as reviews.foo.svc.cluster.local
        subset: v2
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews # interpreted as reviews.foo.svc.cluster.local
        subset: v1
</code></pre>
<p>And the associated DestinationRule</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: reviews-destination
  namespace: foo
spec:
  host: reviews # interpreted as reviews.foo.svc.cluster.local
  subsets:
  - name: v1
    labels:
      version: v1
  - name: v2
    labels:
      version: v2
</code></pre>
<p>The following VirtualService sets a timeout of 5s for all calls to
productpage.prod.svc.cluster.local service in Kubernetes. Notice that
there are no subsets defined in this rule. Istio will fetch all
instances of productpage.prod.svc.cluster.local service from the service
registry and populate the sidecar&rsquo;s load balancing pool. Also, notice
that this rule is set in the istio-system namespace but uses the fully
qualified domain name of the productpage service,
productpage.prod.svc.cluster.local. Therefore the rule&rsquo;s namespace does
not have an impact in resolving the name of the productpage service.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: my-productpage-rule
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  hosts:
  - productpage.prod.svc.cluster.local # ignores rule namespace
  http:
  - timeout: 5s
    route:
    - destination:
        host: productpage.prod.svc.cluster.local
</code></pre>
<p>To control routing for traffic bound to services outside the mesh, external
services must first be added to Istio&rsquo;s internal service registry using the
ServiceEntry resource. VirtualServices can then be defined to control traffic
bound to these external services. For example, the following rules define a
Service for wikipedia.org and set a timeout of 5s for HTTP requests.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: ServiceEntry
metadata:
  name: external-svc-wikipedia
spec:
  hosts:
  - wikipedia.org
  location: MESH_EXTERNAL

<p>Each routing rule is associated with one or more service versions (see
glossary in beginning of document). Weights associated with the version
determine the proportion of traffic it receives. For example, the
following rule will route 25% of traffic for the &ldquo;reviews&rdquo; service to
instances with the &ldquo;v2&rdquo; tag and the remaining traffic (i.e., 75%) to
&ldquo;v1&rdquo;.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1

    - destination:
        host: reviews.prod.svc.cluster.local

    - destination:

<section>
<p>Delay specification is used to inject latency into the request
forwarding path. The following example will introduce a 5 second delay
in 1 out of every 1000 requests to the &ldquo;v1&rdquo; version of the &ldquo;reviews&rdquo;
service from all pods with label env: prod</p>

<p>The <em>fixedDelay</em> field is used to indicate the amount of delay in seconds.
